# How to build your own AutoGPT agent with Forge and test it with Benchmark

## An introduction AutoGPT and autonomous AI agents

[AutoGPT](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/autogpt) is a groundbreaking AI agent leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 APIs to autonomously tackle tasks through natural language

interaction. Unlike traditional systems, it initiates tasks without constant human guidance, adapting its strategies based on evolving information. It adeptly handles

databases, files, web searches, and more, even featuring text-to-speech capabilities. Notably, AutoGPT excels in coding tasks, with potential for self-improvement. From

research to coding and creative writing, it outperforms ChatGPT, executing tasks with precision. Its repository includes

[Forge](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/autogpts/forge), which allows you to easily build your own conversational AI agent powered by AutoGPT, and

[Benchmark](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/benchmark), a tool to test the agent's performance. This tutorial will walk you through the basics of

getting started with both through the command line tools provided by the AutoGPT team. Ready to unleash the full potential of autonomous AI agents? Let's dive in!


### Requirements

Before starting, make sure your development environment meets these requirements:

1. [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
2. An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


### Tutorial Outline

1. Setup
2. Using the User Interface
3. Testing performance with Benchmark


## Setup

To get started, you first need to clone the AutoGPT repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT
```

Run the setup command, which will make sure that you have Python, Poetry, Flutter and Google Chrome installed in your system:

```sh
./run setup
```

**Output**:

```
Setup initiated
...
Installation has been completed.
```

After installation is complete, you can terminate the setup script with CTRL + C. 

See if poetry was installed correctly.

```sh
poetry --version
```

If you get an error, you might need to add Poetry to your PATH:

1. Open the .bashrc file in your home directory (for example, /home/your-user-name/.bashrc) in a text editor.
2. Add export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" at the end of the file.
3. Save the .bashrc file.
4. Restart your terminal.


After that, choose a name for your agents and run the following command:

```sh
./run agents create your_agent_name
```

This command will use Forge to create a new agent.

You can list all available agents with the command:

```sh
./run agents list
```

Now, open the folder where your new agent was created:

```sh
cd autogpts/your_agent_name
```

I created an agent named scraper:

Copy the example environment into a new .env file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the .env file and add your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Your environment should look something like this:

Finally, install the project dependencies:

```sh
poetry install
```

And activate the virtual environment with:

```sh
poetry shell
```

Make sure your virtual environment is always active before running an agent.

That's it! Inside your agent's folder, you can now run it with: 

```sh
./run agents start your_agent_name
```

This command runs the server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 and watches for changes.

## Using the User Interface

Under the hood, the AutoGPT user interface is built with Flutter, the powerful UI toolkit from Google. This allows it to run smoothly on just about any device.

See if you have Flutter installed correctly:

```sh
flutter --version
```

If you get an error, you might need to add Flutter to your PATH:

1. Open the .bashrc file in your home directory (for example, /home/your-user-name/.bashrc) in a text editor.
2. Add export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin" at the end of the file.
3. Save the .bashrc file.
4. Restart your terminal.


With Flutter installed, go to the root folder of the Auto-GPT and run:

```sh
./run frontend
```

This launches the app right in your Chrome browser at `localhost:5000`, and is where you'll spend most of your time as you customize the app.

Each time you save changes, the app auto-refreshes so you can test in real-time.

As you dig into the code, the app will become a custom creation all your own. Build the AI assistant you've always dreamed of!


## Running Tests with Benchmark

To evaluate your agent's capabilities and performance, AutoGPT-Forge includes a comprehensive benchmarking suite.

You can inspect the testing categories with:

```sh
./run benchmark categories list
```

List Benchmark tests:

```sh
./run benchmark tests list
```

And start a Benchmark test for your agent:

```sh
./run benchmark start your_agent_name
```

This will test your agent across many different tasks and metrics to establish baseline capabilities. As you refine your agent, re-run the benchmarks to track improvements.

Individual tests can also be run for more targeted development.

```sh
./run benchmark tests details TestSearch
```

Displays the details of the 'TestSearch' benchmark test.

When you're done, make sure to remember to stop the agent running with the following command:

```sh
./run agents stop
```

You can also exit your Poetry virtual environment with:

```sh
exit
```


These are the basics of AutoGPT. Be aware that this is a project in constant development, so things can evolve quickly. If you want to dive deeper, you can check
