## Introduction
I'm sure many of you have used chatbots in one way or another like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing or Google's Bard. However most chatbots are designed to be good in handling one task or query at a time often through back and forth conversations. 

There are times however, when you need your bot to do a set of complex tasks such as conducting research on a particular topic and then send you a summary of the findings. This is where the term "autonomous agents" come into play. Autonomous agents are basically chatbots on adrenaline that thrive at performing multi steps operations to achieve a particular goal that you set by giving them an objective. You may have heard of various autonomous agents such as AutoGPT, BabyAGI and as per our current focus, SuperAGI.

SuperAGI however is not just an autonomous agent, it goes beyond that by being a framework that allows you to build, manage and run multiple autonomous agents. You can extend an agent capabilities with tools. It is open sourced meaning that the source code is accessible by anyone to use.  The agents efficiently perform a variety of tasks and continually improve their performance with each subsequent run.

In this tutorial, we will be looking at how to get started with SuperAGI and how to build your first autonomous agent. Specifically, we will build an autonomous agent that will be able to find out about a particular topic on the internet, sumarize the findings and send you an email with the summary.

### Prerequisites

Before we get started, you will need to have the following:

* a GitHub account - Github is a code hosting platform. It is where for instance, SuperAGI source code is hosted. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://github.com/signup). This will be used later to create an account on SuperAGI Cloud.
* an OpenAI API key - OpenAI is a company that develops AI models. SuperAGI uses OpenAI's API to generate text. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://beta.openai.com/). Follow the instructions and get yourself verified and the account created. Once you have signed up, you will need to obtain an API key which is a string of numbers and characters. You can do this by clicking your profile icon at the top-right corner of the page once you have logged in and and select "View API Keys." Click "Create New Secret Key" to generate a new API key. Make sure you keep this API key safe as anyone who has the API Key can use your account. 
* a Google App Password - This is not the same as your Gmail password. SuperAGI Cloud can send and read emails on your behalf. To do this, you will need to create an app password for your Gmail account. You can do this by logging in to [https://myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com) using the same google account used for your Gmail account. Select "Security" on the left side of the page. Scroll down to "How you sign in to Google" and select "2 Step Verification" (Make sure it is turned on). Select "App Passwords." You will be prompted to enter your password again. Once you have done that, select "Mail" and "Other" from the drop down menu. Enter "SuperAGI" in the text box and click "Generate." You will be given a 16 character password. Make sure you keep this password safe as anyone who has the password can access your Gmail account.

_Important:_ The App Password is NOT the same password as your GMAIL account password. You will need to use a personal gmail account to obtain the App Password. You cannot use a G Suite account in a straight forward way hence it is beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you do not have a personal gmail account, you can create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).

## Let's get Started

There are several ways in which you can use SuperAGI. But two of the most popular way at the moment is by using a program called Docker or by using a web app made available by the SuperAGI team called SuperAGI Cloud. As this is an introductory tutorial, using Docker might be a bit too complicated for many of you. Hence, let's use SuperAGI Cloud instead.

### Step 1 - Creating you SuperAGI Cloud Account

Once you have all the prerequisites, you can now create your SuperAGI Cloud account. To do this, go to [SuperAGI Cloud](https://superagi.cloud/) and click "Try SuperAGI Cloud" at the top-right corner of the page. You will be prompted to login using your GitHub account. 

Once in, you will need to go to Settings by clicking on the gear icon at the top right hand corner besides your profile picture. Enter your OpenAI API key.

You will then need to enter your Gmail account and the App Password detail you created earlier. This is done by clicking the Toolkits icon on the left hand side and selecting Email Toolkit from the list of toolkits. You will be Email Toolking configuration form.

Fill up with the following detail:

* Email Smtp Port : 587
* Email Signature : (Just type whatever your sign off message is e.g. Regards, Bill)
* Email Imap Server: imap.gmail.com
* Email Draft Mode : FALSE
* Email Address: YOUR GMAIL ADDRESS
* Email Smtp Host : smtp.gmail.com
* Email Draft Folder: Drafts
* Email Password: YOUR GOOGLE APP PASSWORD
