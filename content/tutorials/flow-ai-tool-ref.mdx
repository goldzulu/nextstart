# Flow meets Zephyr and it goes physical
# Grant category
* Educational material

# Description
Wouldn't it be great if you could execute Flow transactions _directly_ from within a bare-bone, physical, hardware platform itself? Using Zephyr RTOS as the underlying operating system, we'll gonna tackle just that.

**What is Zephyr, you might ask?** Well, for those who don't know, it's just [another open-source, highly configurable, real time operating system (RTOS) written in C](https://zephyrproject.org/). It has [support for more then 500 boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html) of various architectures such as ARM, x86, RISC-V, MIPS and others (with more being added all the time) with [a thriving community](https://discord.com/invite/Ck7jw53nU2) of more then [1750 contributors](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/graphs/contributors), having submitted [more then 84000 commits](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commits/main) and merged [more then 42000 pull requests](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pulls) to date. It's being decorated by 8.4k stars and often time ranks in github's [monthly most trending repositories for the C language](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr).

So it's safe to say that there's significant developer interest in this project. This also has to do with the fact that, unlike other RTOSs out there, [Zephyr is under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2016/02/19/the-internet-of-things-goes-open-source-with-linux-foundations-zephyr-project/). This means that, both its code, and its support are of top-notch quality and won't be going nowhere soon.

In terms of security, an overlapping topic with crypto, Zephyr has [its own active group](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/security/security-overview.html) dedicated to maintaining and improving it. This makes it a good web3 host in general.

All in all, Zephyr is an amazingly well engineered project, perfectly suited to house any decentralized-application. This grant aims to leverage this and bridge the knowledge gap between Flow's resource-oriented paradigm and the physical world.

## Problem statement
As a developer, I want to learn to write Flow powered applications that run on non-traditional, native, bare-metal hardware.

## Proposed solution
The deliverables will consist of a well-written Zephyr module project repository that will host a comprehensive demo application. The application will have 2 board targets:

1. [Nordic's nRF7002 development kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF7002-DK), a board that has WiFi capability so we can use it to write a closed, self-sustaining, web3 application
2. a [native POSIX](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/posix/doc/arch_soc.html), intended to be used by people who don't have access to the _nRF7002_ board but still want to play along from home. Zephyr's Native POSIX board targets are great if you want to run your application on the same machine that you use to write the application instead of using a physical board.

This repository will be accompanied by a, human-oriented, medium post (probably spread into 2 parts, for clarity) which will explain everything in good, fun to follow from home, detail.

Of course, emphasis will be put on both the characteristics of Flow and various security aspects of such an application.

The **target audiences** for this grant are:

* C platform-developers who want to develop Flow applications
* makers who want to use crypto in their projects
* general, non-embedded, programmers who want to learn something cool and broaden their horizon

I believe that going ubiquitous is an obvious next step to take for Flow and heterogenous hardware platforms powered by Zephyr could be the ones that triggers this avalanche of refreshed interest.

## Impact
Bringing decentralized-applications closer to the physical world to what is, essentially, an internet-of-things (IoT) development paradigm opens the possibility for new types of applications both for gaming (think of consoles) as well as a plethora of other use-cases.

If this grant is accepted and everything goes well, I do intend to use this experience to pave the way for **developing a full-fledged, developer-oriented, flow-sdk C library** especially tailored for usage in Zephyr applications.
