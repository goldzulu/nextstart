## Introduction

It's madness out there at the moment especially in the world of AI. More and more AI agents are popping up like mushrooms and all over the place.

I used to be able to keep track of new AI Agents coming up per week but now not only did the number grew exponentially, there even different versions of the same agent!

So how do you keep up with all these new agents? How do you know which one is the best? How do you know which one is the most suitable for your use case?

Well, you can't. Not unless you have a way to benchmark them. But how do you benchmark an agent. Most agents out there have their own unique interfaces and unique way of implementation. 

It has hard to compare something side by side when they are so different. It's like comparing apples and oranges.

This is where, the pioneers of autonomous agents (at the time of this writing AutoGPT have more than 149k GitHub stars), the people at AutoGPT and the AI Engineering Foundation comes in wit their Agent Protocol.

In this tutorial, we are going to take a deep dive into the agent protocol and benchmarking techniques. At the same time, as a primer to optimisation, I am going to show you some starting points where you can begin optimising you agents.

In all honesty, I am not the best expert on agent optimisation and I am pretty much learning about this field myself. But I am hoping that by sharing what I know, I can help you get started on your optimisation journey and even goes beyond. (Don't forget about me when you make the big bucks after creating your super duper sentient agent that can take over the world!)

### Prerequisites

This is an intermediate to advance level tutorial. It is assume that you already have the environment setup to begin exploring the optimisation process.

Ideally you would have done the following:

* forked and cloned the AutoGPT repository from  Github [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT.git)
* installed Python 3.10+
* installed Poetry
* installed Flutter 

### Note

The whole AutoGPT repository is still in a state of constant change, so what is shown in this tutorial might be different due to having been chenged or updated. I will try to keep this tutorial as up to date as possible. But if you do find any discrepancies, please let me or the people at LabLab AI know.

### Tutorial Outline

There are three parts to this tutorial.

1. The Agent Protocol - Here, i will cover the basics of the agent protocol, it's structure and tools you can use.

2. Bechmarking - I will cover the basic benchmarking techniques related tools.

3. Prompting and Memory Techniques - I will share some resource to take you further and deeper into prompting and memory technuqyes while covering some common ones.

## The Agent Protocol

The Agent Protocol is built with a vision that one day, all agents have a single standardised communication interface to communicate with.

It is defined in the form of an API Specification, currently [OpenAPI Specification v3](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)

It is worthwhile to note that the specification is currently tech stack agnostic, meaning that it can be implemented in any programming language and framework. Although currently, the reference implementation is in Python.

The specification list endpoints, which the agent should expose with predefined input and response models.

There are two main endpoints:

```POST /agent/tasks``` - for creating tasks

```POST /agent/tasks/{id}/steps``` - for triggering next step for the task

The base objects of the protocol are Tasks, Steps and Artifacts

The following definition are taken from the [Agent Protocol Documentation](https://agentprotocol.ai/protocol) and reproduced here for convenience.

### Task

A `Task` is specific goals that the agent is working towards. It can be narowly specified or broadly specified.

The `Task` object has the following properties:

| Property           | Type              | Description                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `task_id`          | `string`          | The ID of the task.                             |
| `input`            | `string`          | Input prompt for the task.                      |
| `additional_input` | `object`          | Additional input for the task.                  |
| `steps`            | `array[Step]`     | The steps of the task.                          |
| `artifacts`        | `array[Artifact]` | A list of artifacts that the task has produced. |

### Step

A `Step` is a single action that the agent should perform. Each step is triggered by calling the `step` endpoint of the agent. The `Step` object has the following properties:

| Property            | Type              | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task_id`           | `string`          | The ID of the task.                                                    |
| `step_id`           | `string`          | The ID of the step.                                                    |
| `input`             | `string`          | Input prompt for the step.                                             |
| `additional_input`  | `object`          | Additional input for the step.                                         |
| `name`              | `string`          | The name of the step.                                                  |
| `status`            | `enum`            | The status of the step. Possible values are `created` and `completed`. |
| `output`            | `string`          | Output of the step.                                                    |
| `additional_output` | `object`          | Additional output of the step.                                         |
| `artifacts`         | `array[Artifact]` | A list of artifacts that the step has produced.                        |
| `is_last`           | `boolean`         | Whether this is the last step in the task.                             |

### Artifact

An `Artifact` is a file that the agent has worked with. The `Artifact` object has the following properties:

| Property        | Type     | Description                                             |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `artifact_id`   | `string` | The ID of the artifact.                                 |
| `file_name`     | `string` | Filename of the artifact.                               |
| `relative_path` | `string` | Relative path of the artifact in the agent's workspace. |

### Endpoints

The Agent Protocol has two main endpoints:

- `/agent/tasks` **[POST]** - This endpoint is used to create a new task for the agent.
- `/agent/tasks/{task_id}/steps` **[POST]** - This endpoint is used to trigger next step of the task.

To see all endpoints and their descriptions, please refer to the [Endpoints](/endpoints).

### Forge

The Forge is described as a starting point and launchpad for building agents. If you have cloned the AutoGPT repository, you would have seen the Forge folder `autogpts/forge`.

It is a reference implementation of the Agent Protocol in Python that can scafolded out pretty quickly.

#### Agent creation

It is now time to get our hands dirty! To explore further, let's create an agent we can play with. Let's call the agent SkyNet.

Again, you are expected to already know how to create a simple agent using the forge, run the agent using the flutter frontend and perform simple benchmarks.

If you don't, I suggest you take some time to with another beginner level tutorial on how to do this.

For convenience and revision, I will highlight the steps you need to do here at a high level.

At the root of the AutoGPT repository (not the forge directory), execute the followng command 

```sh
./run agent create skynet
```

A new directory `autogpts/skynet` will be created with the reference code. 

Carry on with the following to run your agent:

* `cd autogpts/skynet`
* Install Poetry if you haven't already
* Run `poetry install` to install the project dependencies
* Activate the virtual environment with `poetry shell`
* Make sure you're in the poetry shell
* Copy the example environment file with `cp .env.example .env`.
* Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key. 
* Run your agent with `./run`. This command runs the server and watches for changes.

To verify the agent is running, open Chrome and go to 'http://0.0.0.0:8000'. 

You should see `Welcome to the Auto-GPT Forge` on the page.

#### Agent frontend

The AutoGPT repository comes with a frontend that you can use to interact with your agent. It uses Flutter and is activated by going to the root of the repository and running the following command:

```sh
./run frontend
```

After a while, you should see the frontend running in Chrome at http://localhost:5000

 you do not need to use the ready made frontend. The idea of having all the agent initial code, the frontend and the benchmark tools under one repo is to make it as simple as possible for you you to start.

Some of you might prefer to build for instance the agent and the front end in Javascript or TypeScript. You can do that too although you will need to do development work yourself. 

## Benchmarking

## Prompting and Memory Techniques

## Conclusion

Congratulations! There! You got this! You have now successfully completed the tutorial and created your very own autonomous agent using SuperAGI and hopefully learn a thing or two about autonomous agents!

Hope you find this tutorial useful. Love to hear your feedback!
